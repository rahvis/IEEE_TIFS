## IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics and Security (Manuscript)

This repository contains the source code and dataset required to replicate the results presented in the paper titled "Uncertainty-Aware Multimodal Deep Learning for Guaranteed Coverage in Hardware Trojan Detection."

### Dataset
1. Tabular Data: Includes the source data merged with a synthetic dataset generated using the gretel platform.
2. Graph Data: Consists of processed tensors derived from the source graph data, regenerated using the same platform as the tabular data.
